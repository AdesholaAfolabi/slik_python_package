Data scientists struggle to prepare their data for building machine learning models and all machine learning projects require data wrangling, data preprocessing, feature engineering which takes about 80% of the model building process.

Slik is a data to modeling tool that helps data scientists navigate the issues of basic data wrangling and preprocessing steps. The idea behind Slik is to jump-start supervised learning projects.

Slik has several tools that makes it easy to load data of any format, clean and inspect your data. It offers a quick way to pre-process data and perform feature engineering. Building machine learning models is an inherently iterative task and data scientists face challenges of reproducing the models and productionalizing model pipelines.

With Slik, Data scientists can build model pipelines. Slik provides explainability in the pipeline process in the form of DAG showing each step in the build process. With every build process/experiment, Slik logs the metadata for each run.

Slik provides an easy-to-use solutions for supervised machine learning. Here is a link to the staging repository.

This project tries to help make supervised machine learning more accessible for beginners, and reduce boiler plate for common tasks.

This library is in very active development, so itâ€™s not recommended for production use.

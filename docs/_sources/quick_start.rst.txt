Quickstart to ML with Slik
###############################################

Let's dive right in!

Let's start with the classic. You have the titanic.csv file and want to predict
whether a passenger survived or not based on the information about the
passenger in that file.
We know, for tabular data like this, pandas is our friend.
Clearly we need to start with loading our data. Slik has a read_file function
that reads either CSV, Excel or parquet files

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import slik
    >>> from slik import loadfile as lf
    >>> titanic = lf.read_file('titanic.csv')
        CSV file read sucessfully
        Data has 891 rows and 12 columns

Let's familiarize ourself with the data a bit; what's the shape, what are the
columns, what do they look like?

    >>> titanic.shape
    (891, 12)

    >>> titanic.head() # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    	    PassengerId	Survived  Pclass Name    Sex	Age	SibSp	Parch	Ticket	Fare	Cabin	Embarked
        0	1	0	3	Braund, Mr. Owen Harris	 male	22.0	1	0	A/5 21171	7.2500	NaN	S
        1	2	1	1	Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley female	38.0	1	0	PC 17599	71.2833	C85	C
        2	3	1	3	Heikkinen, Miss. Laina	female	26.0	0	0	STON/O2. 3101282	7.9250	NaN	S
        3	4	1	1	Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath female	35.0	1	0	113803	53.1000	C123	S
        4	5	0	3	Allen, Mr. William Henry	male	35.0	0	0	373450	8.0500	NaN	S

    [5 rows x 14 columns]


So far so good! There's already a bunch of things going on in the data that we
can see here, Lets ask slik to check if there are missing values present in the dataset:

    >>> slik.preprocessing.check_nan(titanic,plot=True,verbose=False)

        .. image:: images/missing_values.png
           :align: center

This provides us with lots of information about percentage count of missing values in different columns. 
In this case, we might have been able to figure this out quickly from the call to head,
but in larger datasets this might be a bit tricky.
For example we can see that there are several dirty columns with "NaN" in it.
let's try and continue with what slik is doing
automatically for now. Now we can handle missing values with slik.

    >>> slik.preprocessing.handle_nan(dataframe=titanic,target_name='Survived',strategy='mean',fillna='mode',
    >>>                                thresh_x=50,thresh_y=50,verbose=False)
        Dropping rows with 50% missing value :Number of records dropped from 891 to 891
        Dropping Columns with 50% missing value: ['Cabin']
        New data shape is (891, 11)


 In slik, we can also identify each columns present in the data:
    
    >>> slik.preprocessing.identify_columns(titanic,'Survived',id_column='PassengerId',project_path='Titanic')
        ------------------------- Identifying columns present in the data -------------------------
        Target column is Survived. Attribute in target column incldes:
        [0, 1]
        Features with high cardinality:['Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin']
        {'cat_feat': ['Name', 'Sex', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'Embarked'],
        'hash_feat': ['Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin'],
        'id_column': 'PassengerId',
        'input_columns': ['Pclass',
                        'Name',
                        'Sex',
                        'Age',
                        'SibSp',
                        'Parch',
                        'Ticket',
                        'Fare',
                        'Cabin',
                        'Embarked'],
        'lower_cat': ['Sex', 'Embarked'],
        'num_feat': ['Pclass', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare'],
        'target_column': 'Survived'}
        ------------------------- Saving Attributes in Yaml file -------------------------
        Data columns successfully identified and attributes are stored in Titanic/metadata
